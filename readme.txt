CodeMilitant OpenGraph Meta Tag Generator is a 'set it and forget it' meta tag generator for WordPress websites. HTML meta tags are required for top search engine rankings.

== Description ==

CodeMilitant OpenGraph Meta Tag Generator

The goal of code should be to work for us, with little to no intervention from the user. This simple philosophy is the way code/computers are supposed to work.

This plugin exists because of the failings of all the rest.

The CodeMilitant OpenGraph Meta Tag Generator provides 100% of all OpenGraph tags available to put your site on the first page of any search engine.

== Installation ==

To provide thorough search engine compliance for maximum search engine rankings, just:

1. From the 'Plugins' menu select 'Add New' or select the 'Add New' button at the top of the plugin list page.
2. Search for 'code-meta' plugin in the search field.
3. Look for the CodeMilitant shield logo and select the 'Install Now' button.
4. That's it! There's no setup required, the plugin does the rest.

Now watch your traffic grow.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do for my website? =

When search engines review your website by crawling through the content, those same search engines are actually reading the raw HTML source. Near the top of any WordPress website you will find a couple HTML meta tags, however, these are not opengraph meta tags. To properly rank any web page, the search engines require opengraph meta tags to properly index the web page in their search engines. By default, WordPress does not provide any opengraph HTML meta tags.

= How do I see if it's working? =

After installing and activating the 'code-meta' plugin, visit one of your pages or posts, then right click any blank area on your page and select 'View Page Source'. This will show you the raw HTML code for that web page. Near the top you will see the HTML meta tags. Here's a partial example from our home page:

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
